# Suinfra CLI

The Suinfra CLI provides a command-line interface to trigger global Sui RPC benchmark tests in 35 regions around the world. Currently, the Suinfra CLI is capable of conducting RPC latency benchmark testing, and we are working on adding support for E2E transaction latency testing as well.
